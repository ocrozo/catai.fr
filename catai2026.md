In the face of contemporary challenges—climate crises, digital transformation, social inequalities, and technological sovereignty—the construction of a <b>sustainable society</b> has become a central scientific objective. It requires systemic responses that combine technological innovation, environmental impact reduction, infrastructure resilience, and social value.

For this CATAÏ 2026 edition, we propose to structure the collaboration around this guiding theme by mobilizing several complementary research lines:

+ <b>HPC</b> : Advancing high-performance computing capabilities to model, simulate, and optimize complex systems for sustainable transitions.

+ <b>Visualization</b> : Developing visualization and analytics tools to make data understandable, shareable, and actionable for researchers, decision-makers, and field stakeholders.

+ <b>Telecommunications / IoT</b> : Designing connected infrastructures that are energy-efficient, resilient, and secure, and adapted to the needs of territories, buildings, and urban services.

+ <b>Software Architecture</b> : Defining robust, scalable, and interoperable software architectures to support distributed applications with strong societal impact.

+ <b>Sustainable City</b> : Exploring integrated approaches to sustainable urban development, combining mobility, energy, housing, data governance, and quality of life.

+ <b>Computing Continuum</b> : Orchestrating cloud, edge, and connected devices to deliver efficient, frugal, and operationally relevant computing pipelines.

## Venue
The workshop will be hosted by Universidad Militar Nueva Granada (UMNG) and will take place across two venues:

+ <b>May 7, 2026</b>: UMNG Calle 100 Building, Bogotá.
+ <b>May 8, 2026</b>: UMNG Cajicá Campus.

### Accommodation
Participants are encouraged to stay in Bogotá for both nights (May 6-7). For participants attending Day 2, UMNG will provide guidance and practical orientation on how to travel from the Calle 100 Campus to the Cajicá Campus. Dedicated transportation will be available for invited VIP participants.

Recommended area:
+ North Bogotá, especially between <b>Calle 85 and Calle 134</b>, for easier access to the Calle 100 Campus.

Hotel suggestions close to Calle 100:
+ [Hotel Estelar Calle 100](https://www.hotelesestelar.com/es/destinos/colombia/bogota/hotel-estelar-calle-100/)
+ [Bogota Plaza Hotel](https://www.bogotaplazahotel.com/)
+ [Hotel BH Usaquen](https://www.bhhoteles.com/bh-usaquen/ubicacion)
+ [Hotel BH Parque 93](https://www.bhhoteles.com/en/bh-parque-93)

These options are generally practical and more affordable than high-end hotels in premium districts. Participants are encouraged to book early and choose refundable rates.
